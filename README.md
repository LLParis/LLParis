## Current Focus

**Building toward UW GRAIL-caliber work** through systematic skill development:

- **Graphics × Gen AI**: Stylization, controllability, temporal consistency
- **Procedural Generation**: Code-driven worlds, constraint systems, variation
- **Simulation & Benchmarks**: Reproducible experiments, evaluation harnesses
- **Long-Horizon Agents**: Memory, planning, multi-step execution

## Roadmap & Repos

Building in public, shipping weekly:

| Repository | Status | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **python-foundations-lab** | 🟡 In Progress | Core Python + upgraded course projects |
| **receipt-cli** | 🟢 Active | CLI tool for receipt management (promoted from coursework) |
| **procgen-sim-lab** | 🔵 Planned | Procedural generation experiments + simulations |
| **eval-benchmarks-lab** | 🔵 Planned | Reproducible benchmarks + evaluation frameworks |
| **longterm-agent-lab** | 🔵 Planned | Memory systems + multi-step planning agents |

## Weekly Cadence

**Rule**: Every week ships a demo clip + commits + 1-page progress log

This profile documents the journey from fundamentals to research-ready capabilities. No inflated claims—just consistent work toward complex systems.
